Input specific numbers and pick a sorting algorithm from the dropdown, then click the Sort button. 
2 buttons will appear (Next and Input Again). Click the next button to see the behavior of the algorithm. 
Only click the Input again button to try the other algorithm or reinput another set of numbers. 

Note:
1. The code was not finished. 
	*No error trapping for character inputs.
	*No proper termination after sorting the array.
	*The Selection Sort option still has bugs during sorting.
2. Also provided a runnable jar file. 

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I am not able to finish the app.
